# LispyJS
Implementation of scheme in javascript

The core functionality was taken from http://norvig.com/lispy.html and a couple bugs were fixed and the errors were made better.

also it was translated from python to javascript, but a bunch of features were lost in translation

the page is hosted here if you want to try it:
