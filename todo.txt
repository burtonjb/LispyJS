TODO.txt

* Fix the debug statements?
* bracket matching in the text input does not work, and its hard to do
* missing values are hard to debug [for example (define (lambda (x) (+ 10 x))) is missing the variable to define. It does not throw a useful error message] 
* More environment functions
* Lispy2 functionality

# actual scheme that works
( begin
 ( define fib
  ( lambda
   ( a)
   ( if
    ( equal? a 0) 0
    ( if
     ( equal? 1 a) 1
     ( +
      ( fib
       ( - a 2))
      ( fib
       ( - a 1)))))))
 ( fib 10)
)
