TODO.txt

* fix bugs for built in functions
* more test cases
* built in functions need to do type checking

* support for macros 
* support for call/cc
* support for ' as a shortcut for quote

* Support splitting up functions into modules. Syntax should be like (require 'module_name')
* more datastructure support (support for dicts)
* support for string functions?

* editor improvements - highlight closing brackets

* missing values are hard to debug [for example (define (lambda (x) (+ 10 x))) is missing the variable to define. It does not throw a useful error message] 
* More environment functions - more built in functions

* error recovery
