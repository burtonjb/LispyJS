TODO.txt
* val for undefined variable does not throw an error (it should!)
* bracket matching in the text input does not work, and its hard to do
* missing values are hard to debug [for example (define (lambda (x) (+ 10 x))) is missing the variable to define. It does not throw a useful error message] 
* global scoping for lambdas right now...
